    <h1>education</h1><br>
    <h2>• Primary Education</h2><br>
    <P>He received his primary education in the city of Porbandar. 
        Being a famous and influential person, some people assume Gandhi was among the brightest students in his school.
        Contrary to this, Gandhi was an average student.
        He was not very good at academics or in any sporting activities, however,
         he grasped some of the most important aspects of his education including good
         morals. 
         He was also a shy and timid student. The school he went to was a school consisting of boys only and was located on the Western Coast of India.</P><br></br>
    

         <h2>•	High School Education </h2><br>

   <p> Gandhi later moved to Rajkot, a city located in the western part of India. The move was necessary due to his father's new job. He joined Alfred High School, an all-boys school, at the age of 11 years. There was a lot of improvement in his performance in high school compared to elementary school.
    
    The young Gandhi who was not good at anything could now be recognized as a good student in various subjects including English. He did not excel in other areas such as Geography. He was still the same shy student but he still maintained the good conduct he had from a very young age. One thing that never changed was his handwriting. It was never pleasing. This is probably due to the fact that he learned by writing on dust using his fingers.
    
    His high school life was a challenge since he married at 13 years and had to take care of his family. His father later got ill which was added a challenge to his life as well as his education.
    
    Alfred High School was later renamed after Gandhi after India's independence. In 2017, the school was closed and converted to a museum.</p><br></br>

    <h2>•	College education</h2><br>

    <p>Despite Mahatma Gandhi's education challenges during his high school years including being taken a year back, Gandhi managed to complete his high school. 
        He enrolled in Samaldas Arts College, the only institution that was offering a degree.
         Gandhi later dropped out of college and went back home to his family in Porbandar.
